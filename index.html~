                                        We will be comparing three different approaches to adapting team of robots to complete a cooperative task. Controller-only, Morphology-only and co-adaptation of controller and morphology. Teams trained with different approaches will be tested on a foraging task on a common platform to compare the effectiveness of each approaches.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        MASON library will be used to create a system to simulate the multi-agent environment. System will be built with java, and will have a graphical user interface to allow the user to input various experiment parameters and be able to see the visual representation of agents as they train.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        The environment will consist of team of homogeneous robots and various type of objects with different dimensions that either need to be collected or avoided. Quantity of robots and objects to be placed will be specified by the user. Goal of the robot team is divided into two stages, stage 1 is to acquire and collect the target objects and bring it back safely to a designated area (home region / nest). Stage 2 requires the collected objects to be arranged in order of their dimensions. Each robot will have a neural controller defining its behaviour, sensory system (morphology) that provides the input informations to the controller and battery system powering the robot with varying consumption rate depending on the morphology of the robot. Based on the approach used, different component of robot will be evolved so that maximum amount of target objects can be retrieved and arranged in the shortest amount of time.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>The Co-Evolution Approach</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            The Co-Evolution approach involves adapting both the morphology and controller of the robot agent. The Morphology and Controller will both be put under evolutionary control. Sensor types and their respective positions determine the morphology of a robot agent. The controller of a robot is represented by an Artificial Neural Network. The inputs to the artifcial neural network are the sensory readings and the outputs drive the right and left wheels of the robot.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            The controller and morphology will be put under evolutionary control. Controllers have been successfully trained using Neuro-Evolution techniques. Common Neuro Evolution techniques only adapt the topology and weights of Artificial Neural Network. Using existing Artificial Neural Network framework, we can add extra sensory parameters as input nodes to the Artificial Neural Network.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            NEAT, a common method used to evolve the topology and weights of an Artificial Neural Network can be adapted to include the sensory configurations of a robot to be adapted in addition to the controller of a robot. Because the weights (and not the input nodes) are adapted by the Evolutionary Algorithms, recurrent network configurations will be made use of. A recurrent connection weight represents a characteristic of a sensor.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>The Controller Evolution Approach</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            For the controller evolution approach, experimenter will decide on a fixed set of morphology to be used by every robots throughout the experiment. Then the neural network controller will be evolved to adapt its behaviour for the pre-defined morphology.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            Neuro-evolution method selected for this approach is Symbiotic Adaptive Neuro-evolution (SANE) [Moriarty and Miikkulainen 1996]. SANE differentiates itself from other NE techniques by evolving population of neurons instead of population of networks. The network is formed by randomly selecting individual neurons to construct the network and each neuron is evaluated by averaging the fitness of the whole network. This technique has the advantage of maintaining population diversity as well as avoiding the competing convention problem.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>The Morphology Approach</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            In this approach, the morphology will be evolved. Given a fixed controller (assumed to be already evolved), the evolutionary process will allow for changes in adapting the sensor types and placement on the robot, this will involve selecting the best configuration of the sensors on the robot, evolving the number of each of sensor type as well as the different sensor parameters (ie orientation, bearing and field of view).
                                            <br /><br />
                                            In this implementation, the topology and weights of the links will be evolved, however, only the neurons and links corresponding to the sensors will be subject to evolution, the rest of the ANN will remained fixed. It has been shown that the morphology of robots can be effectively evolved using a Genetic Algorithm to evolve a floating point string representing the different parameters of the robot morphology.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            There are two different evaluation criteria that can be used. First is the performance of the robot team, i.e whether the were able to complete the task after specified training time. Secondly the training time required to reach the threshold performance, how much time was required to reach satisfactory performance.
                                        </p>

                                            <p>Evolutionary co-evolution of robot sensors and behaviour for multi-robot cooperation.</p>
                                        <h3>Project Description</h3>
                                            <p>
                                            Modern field of robotics focuses on creating intelligent robots. These robots are capable of perceiving the surrounding environment and acts
                                            autonomously to accomplish a given task. They are particularly useful in solving problems in environments that are unsuitable for human workers.
                                            Multi-robot system coordinates the behaviour of a team of multiple robots in a system to accomplish a cooperative task. Multi-robot system has the
                                            benefit of providing redundancy and wider geographical coverage as well as providing solution to problems that couldn’t be solved by single robot.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            However designing these sophisticated multi-robot systems is not free of challenges. In order for robots to accomplish a task, robots need to be
                                            taught the relevant intelligence to accomplish the task (Artificial Intelligence). In order to build a robot and make it accomplish a task, we need
                                            to develop the body and the brain of the robot. We refer to this as the controller and morphology of a robot.  Designing an effective controller and
                                            the morphology for a given task requires extensive knowledge regarding the robots, task and the environment involved. Furthermore the robots are
                                            designed for a very specific task and are are not suitable to be used in wide range of application.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            Evolutionary robotics (ER) was introduced to overcome these issues. This approach combines the field of robotics and machine learning (a subfield of
                                            Artificial Intelligence) to solve the mentioned design problem, by using evolutionary algorithms (EA) to adapt the behaviour and morphology of the
                                            robots rather than requiring a detailed hand design from the human designer. The unsupervised nature of EAs makes it possible to train robots in
                                            domains with low supply of training data. Ideally the training are done offline in a simulated environment to increase the speed of learning and avoid
                                            engineering problems and possible damage to robots during learning (crashing into walls etc.). After the evolution process completes the evolved
                                            controller and morphology are ported to robots in a real world environment.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            There are abundance of researches done for evolving the controllers for an evolutionary multi-robot systems. However little research has been done on
                                            co-evolving the morphology along with the controller, even though there are papers emphasizing the importance of morphology on the performance of
                                            robot systems. This project aims to prove that co-evolution of controller and morphology is the best ER approach by comparing it with approaches that
                                            only evolve the controller or the morphology.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            Simulated multi-robot system will be developed to test and evaluate the robot teams evolved with different approaches. The robots will be an abstraction
                                            of a Khepera robot, using artificial neural network (ANN) as a controller and will make use of multiple sensors of different types. Team of robots will
                                            be given two cooperative tasks to accomplish.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            The first task that we wish for our robots to accomplish is a task where autonomous mobile robot cooperate in a “trash collection” exercise. The trash
                                            collection exercise is a task where robots go out into the simulated environment - look for trash and return it to a home base. The second part of the
                                            problem is for the robots to organise the ‘trash’ in a specified manner at the home base. Details of the experiment is described in the Procedures and
                                            Methods section.

                                            Below is the summary of the project description:

                                                    <p>
                                                        Accurately designing the controllers and morphologies of multi-robot system to carry out wide range of collective behaviour task is very difficult and time consuming. Evolutionary robotics provides a solution to this problem by allowing the design process of robot teams to be automated.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        Research in the field of Evolutionary Robotics also allows us to build an arbitrary robot system : a similar methodology and algorithm can be applied to other robotics applications. With the ability to build an arbitrary robot system, we can reduce the need for specialised skills in a particular robot system or task.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        The same techniques can be applied to robots of different size and morphology, different tasks and and competition instead of cooperation between robots.

                                                        Potential use of multi-robot systems in contemporary problem includes search and rescue, collective foraging and collective construction.

                                                    <p><b>What are the issues and difficulties?</b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Apart from the inherent complexity of designing a robot (lots of variables and movements and pieces put together), the key issues for  multi-robot systems for collective tasks are the complex design process of the controllers and morphologies. Global behaviour of the robot team is the emergent behaviour resulting from dynamic interactions of individual robots with themselves and the environment. When designing a controller, It is difficult to identify the individual behaviours of robots that would result in the desired global behaviour. Different configuration of morphologies offers different advantages. Some configuration allows the robots to excel at a specific task but other configuration may allow the robots to be used in more general applications. Deciding on a configuration that allows wide range of application as well as maintaining sufficient performance can be quite challenging.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        Another problem is the simulated environment - the real world has noise and is stochastic, making it very hard to abstract perfectly into a simulated platform. Which means that controllers and morphologies evolved through simulation may not perform as well in the real world applications. This issue is a definite on-going problem in the field of evolutionary robotics, but in our project we will only focus on training for the simulated environment.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        The robot system needs to undergo a huge amount of training. Training robots systems can be an intensive task for computers which may take months to train. There are many Evolutionary Algorithms in the past that have taken several months to train a robot.

                                        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                Certain tasks are too complex to be solved with a solution that is written as a simple heuristic, the particular problem in this cases is a foraging and construction task, which requires co-operation between a team of robot agents. Our aim is to figure out which of the multiple approaches to the design of the controller and sensory configurations (morphology) of this team of homogeneous robots is best fit for a problem of this nature.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                A comparison will be made between system agents whose ANNs have been trained using different approaches:

                                            <ul>

                                                    <p>
                                                        Evolving the controller of the agents while keeping the morphology of the robots fixed
                                                    </p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Evolving the morphology of the agents for a fixed evolved controller
                                                    </p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Simultaneously evolving both the controller and morphology of the agents.
                                                    </p>
                                                </li>

                                            <p>
                                            We intend to use the first two approaches (evolving either only the controller or the morphology) as control cases to help support our hypothesis. That the systems with simultaneous controller and morphology evolution will outperform the other two cases.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Procedures and Methods</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                We will be comparing three different approaches to adapting team of robots to complete a cooperative task. Controller-only, Morphology-only and co-adaptation of controller and morphology. Teams trained with different approaches will be tested on a foraging task on a common platform to compare the effectiveness of each approaches.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                MASON library will be used to create a system to simulate the multi-agent environment. System will be built with java, and will have a graphical user interface to allow the user to input various experiment parameters and be able to see the visual representation of agents as they train.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                The environment will consist of team of homogeneous robots and various type of objects with different dimensions that either need to be collected or avoided. Quantity of robots and objects to be placed will be specified by the user. Goal of the robot team is divided into two stages, stage 1 is to acquire and collect the target objects and bring it back safely to a designated area (home region / nest). Stage 2 requires the collected objects to be arranged in order of their dimensions. Each robot will have a neural controller defining its behaviour, sensory system (morphology) that provides the input informations to the controller and battery system powering the robot with varying consumption rate depending on the morphology of the robot. Based on the approach used, different component of robot will be evolved so that maximum amount of target objects can be retrieved and arranged in the shortest amount of time.

                                            <h4>The Co-Evolution Approach</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                The Co-Evolution approach involves adapting both the morphology and controller of the robot agent. The Morphology and Controller will both be put under evolutionary control. Sensor types and their respective positions determine the morphology of a robot agent. The controller of a robot is represented by an Artificial Neural Network. The inputs to the artifcial neural network are the sensory readings and the outputs drive the right and left wheels of the robot.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                The controller and morphology will be put under evolutionary control. Controllers have been successfully trained using Neuro-Evolution techniques. Common Neuro Evolution techniques only adapt the topology and weights of Artificial Neural Network. Using existing Artificial Neural Network framework, we can add extra sensory parameters as input nodes to the Artificial Neural Network.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                NEAT, a common method used to evolve the topology and weights of an Artificial Neural Network can be adapted to include the sensory configurations of a robot to be adapted in addition to the controller of a robot. Because the weights (and not the input nodes) are adapted by the Evolutionary Algorithms, recurrent network configurations will be made use of. A recurrent connection weight represents a characteristic of a sensor.
                                            </p>
                                            <h4>The Controller Evolution Approach</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                For the controller evolution approach, experimenter will decide on a fixed set of morphology to be used by every robots throughout the experiment. Then the neural network controller will be evolved to adapt its behaviour for the pre-defined morphology.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                Neuro-evolution method selected for this approach is Symbiotic Adaptive Neuro-evolution (SANE) [Moriarty and Miikkulainen 1996]. SANE differentiates itself from other NE techniques by evolving population of neurons instead of population of networks. The network is formed by randomly selecting individual neurons to construct the network and each neuron is evaluated by averaging the fitness of the whole network. This technique has the advantage of maintaining population diversity as well as avoiding the competing convention problem.
                                            </p>
                                            <h4>The Morphology Approach</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                In this approach, the morphology will be evolved. Given a fixed controller (assumed to be already evolved), the evolutionary process will allow for changes in adapting the sensor types and placement on the robot, this will involve selecting the best configuration of the sensors on the robot, evolving the number of each of sensor type as well as the different sensor parameters (ie orientation, bearing and field of view).
                                                <br /><br />
                                                In this implementation, the topology and weights of the links will be evolved, however, only the neurons and links corresponding to the sensors will be subject to evolution, the rest of the ANN will remained fixed. It has been shown that the morphology of robots can be effectively evolved using a Genetic Algorithm to evolve a floating point string representing the different parameters of the robot morphology.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                There are two different evaluation criteria that can be used. First is the performance of the robot team, i.e whether the were able to complete the task after specified training time. Secondly the training time required to reach the threshold performance, how much time was required to reach satisfactory performance.
